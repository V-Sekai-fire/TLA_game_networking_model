# AV1 Trees and 3D Cells

## Research Websites

```
(1) Investigate the AV1 Video Codec's block partitioning mechanism by:
   (a) Searching for detailed explanations of AV1's macroblock multitype tree, superblock partitioning, and coding tree structure.
   (b) Analyzing how this tree structure enables flexible division of video frames into blocks of varying sizes and types for encoding and decoding.
   (c) Clarifying how different prediction methods (intra-frame and inter-frame) are applied to these partitioned blocks to optimize compression efficiency, with a specific focus on the intra-frame partitioning for dividing a single video frame.
(2) Explore the user's analogy of a "multitype tree" in 3D simulation by:
   (a) Analyzing the provided description: "partitioned cells that have layers that are used like sim city to simulate water, and power and shadow layers that are like materialized views."
   (b) Researching concepts related to hierarchical spatial data structures for simulation, 3D grid partitioning with multiple data layers, octrees for layered geospatial data, or volumetric data with attribute layers.
   (c) Synthesizing how a tree structure could represent and manage such 3D partitioned cells with distinct layers (e.g., water, power, shadow) akin to materialized views.
(3) Compare and contrast the AV1 block partitioning tree with the 3D simulation tree analogy by:
   (a) Identifying the core principles of hierarchical and adaptive partitioning in both the AV1 video coding context and the described 3D simulation context.
   (b) Discussing the similarities in how "multitype" characteristics (e.g., different block types/prediction modes in AV1; different data layers or cell properties in the 3D analogy) are handled within a partitioned unit.
   (c) Highlighting the differences in their primary application domains (video compression versus 3D environmental simulation) and potential specific implementation details.
(4) Research the Left-Child Right-Sibling (LCRS) binary tree representation by:
   (a) Searching for comprehensive information on its definition, how general trees are converted to this form, and common algorithms associated with it.
   (b) Explaining the structure of an LCRS tree, detailing how each node typically uses two pointers: one for its first child (left) and one for its next sibling (right).
(5) Evaluate the statement that a "left-child right-sibling binary tree can be used on any tree for benefits" by:
   (a) Confirming the universal applicability of the LCRS representation for any arbitrary tree structure.
   (b) Investigating and enumerating the specific benefits of using the LCRS representation, such as memory efficiency for trees with high or variable branching factors, a uniform node structure, and efficiencies in certain tree traversal algorithms.
   (c) Exploring any potential drawbacks, limitations, or trade-offs when compared to other common tree representations (e.g., access time to a specific n-th child, or suitability for particular applications).
