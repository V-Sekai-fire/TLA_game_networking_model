(1) For each datastore candidate (Khepri, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, TiDB, MongoDB, DynamoDB, CosmosDB, FoundationDB), compile comprehensive information covering: transactional capabilities, performance benchmarks (especially for RMW operations against specified targets), Elixir compatibility (drivers, Ecto adapters, maturity), data modeling flexibility (for varied and advanced structures like cellular/layered/materialized-views models), querying power for complex patterns, Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanisms, operational maturity (community, support, deployments, ease of use), developer experience for Elixir users, scalability, fault tolerance, and licensing/TCO (including specific metrics like 0.02 USD per CCU hour where applicable).
(2) Investigate and analyze how the proposed "Advanced Data Structuring" concepts (AV1-inspired partitioning, layered data, LCRS for hierarchy) can be practically implemented or approximated within the leading datastore candidates, detailing potential trade-offs (e.g., denormalization, query complexity, indexing) and support for features like per-partition counters and materialized views.
(3) Conduct a focused evaluation of FoundationDB, examining its core ordered key-value store features, transactional guarantees, "layers" concept for data modeling, and its suitability relative to the project's needs for a mature, "weathered" datastore, considering both general-purpose use and as a base for custom solutions with Elixir.
(4) For the top 2-3 shortlisted datastore candidates, research potential risks (technical, operational, performance, vendor lock-in) and find documented mitigation strategies relevant to each.
(5) Research best practices and established methodologies for designing and executing Proof of Concept (PoC) tests and benchmarks for distributed datastores, focusing on simulating realistic gaming workloads (e.g., RMW-Units/s), implementing simplified versions of the project's cellular/layered/materialized-views data model, and defining representative query patterns for evaluation.
(6) Gather detailed information on the Elixir ecosystem for the shortlisted datastores, including the maturity, performance, documentation, and community support for Elixir drivers (e.g., myxql, postgrex) and Ecto adapters, and assess the overall developer experience from an Elixir perspective.
(7) Compile information on best practices for planning the implementation of the selected datastore within a gaming platform, covering: detailed schema design for advanced data structures, data migration strategies, application integration patterns with Elixir services (Ecto usage, transaction management, connection pooling), and the creation of operational playbooks (deployment, monitoring, backup/restore, scaling, disaster recovery).
(8) Research post-implementation best practices for managing and evolving the chosen datastore, including continuous monitoring techniques, performance optimization strategies (query tuning, indexing), cost management, approaches for iterating on data models as game features change, and methods for staying informed about updates to the datastore and its Elixir clients.
