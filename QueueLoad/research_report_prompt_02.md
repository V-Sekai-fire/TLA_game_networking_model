Navigating the Datascape: Action Plan

Phase 1: Completing the Current Datastore Investigation Report (Incorporating Advanced Data Structuring Insights)

Your existing document is an excellent foundation. The "plan" here is to structure the completion of the report (Sections 4-8) and ensure the insights from the "Advanced Data Structuring" document are deeply integrated into the evaluation criteria, especially concerning data modeling and query patterns.

Objective: Finalize a comprehensive report that clearly evaluates datastore candidates against defined requirements, including those derived from advanced data structuring needs.

Key Activities:Define Missing Report Sections (Suggestive Outline):Section 4: Consolidated Comparative Analysis & Scorecard:Create a summary table/matrix comparing all shortlisted candidates (Khepri, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, TiDB, MongoDB, DynamoDB, CosmosDB, and potentially FoundationDB given its mention) across all key criteria:Transactional Capabilities (ACID, scope, isolation)

Performance (p99 latency for RMW, throughput, scalability - measured against your 7-15ms & 100k ops/sec targets)

Elixir Compatibility (Ecto adapters, native drivers, maturity)

Data Modeling Flexibility (suitability for game entities, relational, tree-like, document, and the cellular/layered/partitioned model from the second document)

Querying Capabilities (support for complex queries arising from the advanced data structures)

Change Data Capture (CDC) / Eventing (for shadow layer & other needs)

Operational Maturity & "Weatheredness" (community, support, real-world large-scale deployments, ease of operations, backup/restore, monitoring)

Developer Experience (ease of use, learning curve for Elixir devs)

Scalability & Elasticity

Fault Tolerance & Resilience (Raft usage, consensus protocols)

Licensing & Cost (TCO considerations if applicable)

Section 5: Deep Dive into Data Modeling for Cellular Simulations:Explicitly analyze how the "Advanced Data Structuring" concepts (AV1-inspired partitioning, layered data, LCRS for hierarchy) would be implemented or approximated in the top 2-3 datastore candidates.

Discuss the trade-offs (e.g., denormalization, query complexity, indexing strategies) for each candidate when mapping these advanced structures.

How would phenomena like numEntities and requestQueue per cell (or sub-partition) be managed?

How would "materialized views" or pre-aggregated data for layers be supported/emulated?

Section 6: Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies:For the top 2-3 candidates, identify specific risks (technical, operational, performance, vendor lock-in, etc.).

Propose mitigation strategies for each significant risk.

Section 7: Proof of Concept (PoC) Definition & Benchmarking Plan:This will be a crucial output of the report. Detail the plan for Phase 2 (see below).

Section 8: Preliminary Recommendations & Decision Framework:Based on the paper analysis, provide preliminary recommendations or a narrowed-down list.

Define the final decision-making framework/criteria to be used after the PoC phase.

Integrate "Advanced Data Structuring" Insights:Review each datastore candidate specifically through the lens of the cellular, partitioned, and layered data model.

For instance, how would Khepri's tree-like model adapt? How would DistSQL handle hierarchical partitioning and layer queries? How would NoSQL document models or DynamoDB's single-table design accommodate this?

The LCRS concept is more about in-memory representation within the application (GLS), but its implications for data serialization and storage in the chosen datastore should be considered.

Incorporate FoundationDB:Since "FoundationDB is open too," briefly evaluate it against the same criteria. Its core strength is its ordered key-value store with excellent transactional guarantees. It's a lower-level building block, so consider if it fits the "mature, weathered" general-purpose datastore desire or leans more towards the "custom solution" path (albeit with a very solid foundation). Note its own "layers" concept for building higher-level data models.

Peer Review: Have the completed report reviewed by team members for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.

Phase 2: Proof of Concept (PoC) and Benchmarking

Objective: Empirically validate the performance, Elixir integration, and data modeling capabilities of the top 2-3 shortlisted candidates using a representative gaming workload.

Key Activities:Select PoC Candidates: Based on Phase 1, choose the most promising datastores. TiDB seems like a strong contender. Consider one other Distributed SQL (e.g., CockroachDB for its postgrex maturity) and potentially one NoSQL option if it showed specific strengths for your data model. If FoundationDB is seriously considered for a more custom approach, it could be a PoC candidate.

Define Realistic Workload & Data Model:Simulate the target ~1,000 RMW-Units/s per Game Logic Server (GLS). Clearly define what an "RMW-Unit" entails in terms of data size, complexity, and operations.

Implement a simplified version of your envisioned cellular/layered data model on each PoC candidate.

Include representative query patterns based on this model (e.g., spatial queries within a cell, cross-layer queries, entity updates).

Develop Test Harness (Elixir-based):Use the identified Elixir drivers and Ecto adapters. This will test their maturity and performance.

For TiDB, this means validating myxql thoroughly. For CockroachDB/YugabyteDB, postgrex is expected.

Execute Benchmarks:Measure throughput (ops/sec) and latency (average, p95, p99, especially for RMW operations).

Test scalability by increasing the number of GLS instances or the load per GLS.

Evaluate CDC mechanisms in practice: ability to stream changes durably and in order.

Assess transactional integrity under concurrent load and potential failure scenarios (node outages).

Monitor resource utilization on the datastore nodes.

Evaluate Developer Experience:Assess ease of schema design, querying, and integration from an Elixir developer's perspective.

Note any friction points with drivers or Ecto adapters.

Document PoC Findings: Rigorously document benchmark results, challenges encountered, and qualitative assessments.

Phase 3: Analysis, Final Selection, and Implementation Planning

Objective: Select the optimal datastore and develop a high-level plan for its adoption.

Key Activities:Analyze PoC Results: Compare candidates based on empirical data against the decision framework defined in Phase 1.

Re-evaluate Risks: Update risk assessment based on PoC findings.

Consider Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): Factor in licensing (if any), infrastructure, operational overhead, and development effort.

Make Final Datastore Selection: Choose the datastore that best meets the overall requirements. Document the rationale clearly.

Develop High-Level Implementation Plan:Schema Design: Detailed schema based on the chosen datastore and the advanced data structuring model.

Data Migration Strategy (if applicable): If replacing an existing system.

Application Integration: Plan for integrating with Elixir services, including Ecto usage patterns, transaction management, and connection pooling.

Operational Playbook: Outline plans for deployment, monitoring, backup/restore, scaling, and disaster recovery.

Training & Skill Development: Identify any team training needs.

Pilot Project (Optional but Recommended): Implement the chosen datastore for a non-critical new service or a limited slice of the game to gain further experience before a full rollout.

Phase 4: Implementation and Iteration

Objective: Successfully integrate the chosen datastore into the gaming platform.

Key Activities:Execute Implementation Plan: Carry out the activities defined in Phase 3.

Continuous Monitoring & Optimization: Post-launch, continuously monitor performance, cost, and reliability. Optimize queries, indexing, and configurations as needed.

Iterate on Data Models: As game features evolve, the data model may need refinement.

Stay Updated: Keep abreast of updates and new features for the chosen datastore and its Elixir clients.

Overarching Considerations:

Elixir Focus: Maintain a strong focus on seamless and performant Elixir integration throughout.

Team Expertise: Consider the current and future expertise of your team when evaluating the learning curve and operational complexity of each solution.

Community & Ecosystem: A strong community and mature ecosystem around a datastore (and its Elixir clients) can be invaluable.

Iterative Approach: Don't aim for perfection in the first pass. The PoC phase is for learning. The implementation can also be iterative.
