(1) For each of the following datastores: Khepri, CockroachDB, YugabyteDB, TiDB, MongoDB, DynamoDB, CosmosDB, and FoundationDB, conduct web searches to find comprehensive information covering:
   (a) Transactional capabilities (e.g., ACID compliance, isolation levels).
   (b) Performance benchmarks, particularly focusing on Read-Modify-Write (RMW) operations and any available data against specified performance targets.
   (c) Elixir compatibility, including available drivers, Ecto adapters, and their respective maturity levels.
   (d) Data modeling flexibility, specifically for varied and advanced structures like cellular models, layered data models, and materialized views.
   (e) Querying capabilities suitable for complex data access patterns.
   (f) Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanisms and their features.
   (g) Operational maturity, assessed through community activity, availability of enterprise support, documented large-scale deployments, and ease of operational management.
   (h) Developer experience, with a focus on Elixir users.
   (i) Scalability characteristics, including horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities and auto-scaling features.
   (j) Fault tolerance mechanisms and guarantees.
   (k) Licensing models and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), including searching for specific pricing metrics like '0.02 USD per CCU hour' where such information is publicly available.
(2) Investigate how 'Advanced Data Structuring' concepts, such as AV1-inspired partitioning, layered data, and Left-Child Right-Sibling (LCRS) for hierarchy representation, can be practically implemented or approximated in promising datastore candidates identified from the previous research. For each, find information on:
   (a) Potential implementation strategies or common workarounds.
   (b) Associated trade-offs, such as denormalization needs, impact on query complexity, and indexing considerations.
   (c) Native or achievable support for features like per-partition counters and materialized views in the context of these advanced structures.
(3) Conduct a focused web search evaluation of FoundationDB. Investigate its:
   (a) Core features as an ordered key-value store and its underlying architecture.
   (b) Transactional guarantees, including ACID properties and supported isolation levels.
   (c) 'Layers' concept for data modeling and examples of its practical application.
   (d) Overall suitability as a mature and 'weathered' datastore for general-purpose applications and as a foundation for custom data solutions, particularly those involving Elixir.
(4) For the top 2-3 datastore candidates shortlisted based on the preceding research, perform web searches to identify:
   (a) Potential risks associated with each, categorized into technical (e.g., limitations, complexity), operational (e.g., manageability, monitoring), performance (e.g., bottlenecks, unpredictable latency), and vendor lock-in aspects.
   (b) Documented mitigation strategies or best practices for addressing these identified risks.
(5) Search for best practices and established methodologies for designing and executing Proof of Concept (PoC) tests and benchmarks for distributed datastores. Focus on finding information related to:
   (a) Simulating realistic gaming workloads, including metrics like Read-Modify-Write Units per second (RMW-Units/s) or similar throughput/latency measures for concurrent operations.
   (b) Methodologies for implementing simplified yet representative versions of the project's cellular, layered, and materialized-views data models for testing purposes.
   (c) Defining characteristic query patterns to evaluate datastore performance and suitability under these specific data models and workloads.
(6) For the shortlisted datastore candidates, gather detailed information from web searches on their Elixir ecosystem. This includes looking for:
   (a) The maturity, performance characteristics, quality of documentation, and community support for available Elixir drivers (such as myxql, postgrex, or drivers specific to NoSQL databases).
   (b) The maturity, feature set, and community support for Ecto adapters, if applicable.
   (c) General developer sentiment and reported experiences when using these datastores with Elixir, based on online forums, articles, and official documentation.
(7) Research best practices for planning the implementation of a selected datastore within a gaming platform. Cover the following areas through web searches:
   (a) Techniques for detailed schema design tailored to advanced data structures like cellular, layered, and materialized views.
   (b) Strategies for data migration from existing systems or for efficient initial data loading.
   (c) Common application integration patterns with Elixir services, focusing on Ecto usage (if applicable), effective transaction management, and connection pooling strategies.
   (d) Guidance on creating comprehensive operational playbooks that cover deployment, monitoring, backup and restore procedures, scaling strategies, and disaster recovery plans.
(8) Conduct web searches to find post-implementation best practices for managing and evolving a chosen datastore in a production environment. Focus on:
   (a) Effective continuous monitoring techniques and key performance indicators (KPIs) to track.
   (b) Common performance optimization strategies, including query tuning, appropriate indexing, and caching mechanisms.
   (c) Cost management and optimization techniques relevant to the chosen datastore's pricing model.
   (d) Flexible approaches for iterating on data models in response to evolving game features and requirements.
   (e) Methods for staying informed about updates, security advisories, and new features for both the datastore and its Elixir client libraries.
