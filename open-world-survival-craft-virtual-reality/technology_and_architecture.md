# Proposed Technology Stack & Architectural Approach

Our technical approach leverages Elixir for concurrent backend logic, WebRTC for real-time communication, and FoundationDB for persistent data storage. This stack supports highly responsive and scalable gameplay. Architectural principles include tiered state management (in-memory for speed, database for persistence), world sharding for scalability, and asynchronous operations for responsiveness.

## Illustrative Game Problem: Cooperative Ritual - Awakening an Ancient Shrine

This scenario showcases how our tech supports complex, cooperative VR gameplay.

**Scenario:** Two players in VR discover an Ancient Shrine. Their goal is to perform a cooperative ritual to awaken it and receive a "Divine Blessing." This involves:

- **Expressive Avatars:** Players use VRM avatars that mirror their movements.
- **Shrine Entity:** The Shrine has states like `ActivationProgress`, `required_offerings_met`, and `ritual_phase`.
- **Offering Items:** Players gather/craft items like "Sunstone Shards" to offer.

## Player Actions & Social VR Elements:

### Offering & Initial Activation:

- Players find the Shrine and identify the need for offerings.
- They select items from their VR inventory and physically place them. An RPC `place_offering(...)` is sent.
- The Elixir backend validates offerings against the Shrine's requirements (stored in FoundationDB). If valid, `required_offerings_met` becomes true. Visual feedback is synchronized to all clients.

### Synchronized Ritual Performance:

- Players move to ritual spots. An RPC `begin_ritual_performance(...)` triggers animations.
- Players perform synchronized physical movements (e.g., rhythmic hand raising, tracing patterns).
- Clients send `controller_motion_data` via WebRTC. The Elixir backend processes these streams, evaluating synchronization and correctness to update `ActivationProgress`.
- As `ActivationProgress` increases, Shrine visuals/audio intensify, and avatar effects (e.g., shaders, particles) enhance immersion, all synchronized from the server.

### Shrine Awakening & Blessing Bestowed:

- Reaching `MaxActivation` triggers a climactic event.
- The server sends an RPC `shrine_activated_apply_blessing(...)`.
- A "Divine Blessing" (e.g., "+20% gathering speed") is applied to player data (managed by Elixir, persisted in FoundationDB).
- Client UIs update. Poor performance might result in weaker blessings or failure. The Shrine may enter a cooldown.

## Technical Solution Highlights:

### Real-time Logic & State (Elixir & OTP):

- Elixir GenServers manage individual Shrine states and player interactions (RPCs, motion data).
- Handles complex logic: validating offerings, evaluating synchronized movements, calculating `ActivationProgress`.
- OTP ensures fault tolerance for uninterrupted gameplay.
- Player state (inventory, blessings) is managed authoritatively by Elixir.

### Persistent & Consistent Storage (FoundationDB):

- Shrine state (`ActivationProgress`, `required_offerings_met`), player progression (inventories, blessings), and ritual definitions are stored.
- ACID transactions ensure atomic operations (e.g., consuming offerings, granting blessings).

### Low-Latency Communication (WebRTC):

- High-frequency `controller_motion_data` is sent efficiently.
- Critical state changes and visual triggers are broadcast reliably, ensuring a synchronized experience.
- Elixir manages WebRTC signaling.

### Tiered State Management in Action:

- **Ultra-Hot (Elixir In-Memory):** Active ritual data (`ActivationProgress`, motion data queues) for sub-millisecond access.
- **Warm (Elixir Cache):** Frequently accessed regional shrine definitions.
- **Cold (FoundationDB):** Authoritative store for all persistent game data.

This approach allows for rich, interactive, and scalable social VR experiences like the cooperative ritual, directly leveraging the strengths of the chosen technologies.
