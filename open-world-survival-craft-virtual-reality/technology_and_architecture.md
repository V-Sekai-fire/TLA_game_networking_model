# Proposed Technology Stack & Architectural Approach

To address the aforementioned challenges, the following MIT-compatible (or similarly permissive, e.g., Apache 2.0, BSD) technology stack and architectural considerations are proposed:

**Core Backend Technologies:**

- **Elixir (Apache 2.0 License):**
  - Leverage OTP (Open Telecom Platform) for massive concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed state management.
  - Use GenServers/Agents for managing individual player states, game entities, or regional logic, enabling high responsiveness for critical interactions.
  - Addresses: _Extreme Transactional Throughput & Concurrency_, _Ultra-Low Latency (for in-memory operations)_, _Scalability & Availability_.
- **WebRTC Data Channels (UDP-based via DTLS-SRTP):**
  - Provide low-latency, real-time, bidirectional communication suitable for game clients (Godot) and web-based tooling.
  - Data channels can be configured for unreliable/unordered (for game state) or reliable/ordered (for critical messages, admin tasks) transport over UDP.
  - Godot Engine has built-in WebRTC support. Elixir can act as a WebRTC peer and handle the signaling process (which could be a lightweight WebSocket setup, potentially still involving parts of Phoenix if desired for robustness for signaling, or a simpler custom solution).
  - Native browser support makes it suitable for web-based admin and community management tools.
  - Addresses: _Ultra-Low Latency for VR Immersion_, flexible real-time data transport.
- **FoundationDB (Apache 2.0 License) with `ecto_foundationdb` (Apache 2.0 License):**
  - Serve as the primary persistent datastore. FoundationDB offers distributed, transactional key-value storage with strong ACID guarantees (strict serializability).
  - Ecto provides a powerful and familiar way to model, query, and transact with this data from Elixir.
  - Addresses: _Immense Data Volume & Granularity_, _Extreme Transactional Throughput & Concurrency_, _Strong Data Consistency & Integrity_, _Scalability & Availability_. The atomic `ProcessInputsAndUpdateWorld` transaction described in `ExtendedWorldState.tla` can be directly implemented using FoundationDB's transactional capabilities.

**Architectural Principles:**

- **Tiered State Management:**
  1.  **Ultra-Hot Data (In-Memory Elixir Processes):** For sub-20ms critical loops, manage state directly in Elixir GenServers/Agents. This state is ultimately persisted to FoundationDB.
  2.  **Warm Data (Cached in Regional Elixir Processes):** For consistent, low-latency operations for specific game systems or regions, frequently accessed data can be cached within regional Elixir processes. This state is read from and ultimately persisted to FoundationDB.
  3.  **Cold/Persistent Data (FoundationDB):** The authoritative, globally consistent, and durable store for all game state that needs to be readily accessible.
- **Sharding/Regionalization:** The game world can be sharded, with different sets of Elixir processes (potentially managing cached data regionally) responsible for distinct areas, all persisting to the global FoundationDB instance.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** For non-critical updates or background tasks, leverage Elixir's message passing to offload work and maintain responsiveness.

This combination aims to provide the necessary tools to build a backend that is scalable, resilient, consistent, and performant enough for the ambitious goals of V-Sekai, while adhering to permissive licensing. The system design can mirror the state transitions and data structures (like `worldEntities`, `entityState`, `playerInputs`) defined in `ExtendedWorldState.tla`.
