Okay, the user wants to repeat the final plan for making the simulation cheaper. Let me recall the previous interaction. The user had a detailed technical report and wanted to estimate the work needed to simulate the system with Raft and Parallel Commits TLA+ specs. Then they asked how to make it cheaper, and I provided a strategy focusing on simplifying the model, reusing specs, prioritizing properties, optimizing TLC, and incremental verification. The final plan outlined a 66% cost reduction by cutting effort from 19 to 6.5 days.

Now, the user is asking to "repeat the final plan." They probably want a concise summary of the optimized approach without going through the entire thought process again. I should present the key steps clearly, maybe in bullet points or sections, highlighting the main strategies and the resulting cost savings. Need to ensure it's easy to follow and captures all the critical points from the previous answer. Also, check if there's any additional context or if the user needs further clarification, but since they just want the plan repeated, stick to the structured summary.

### **Optimized Final Plan: Low-Cost Simulation of Raft + Parallel Commits System**

#### **1. Simplify the Model**

- **3-node cluster** (1 leader, 2 followers) instead of 5 nodes.
- **Abstract networking** (ignore QUIC/HTTP3 details, use async channels).
- **Discrete time steps** (3ms increments instead of 1ms).

#### **2. Reuse Existing Specs**

- **Leverage pre-built TLA+ modules**:
  - [Raft (Ongardie)](https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla) for consensus logic.
  - [AWS HLC](https://github.com/aws/tla-plus) for hybrid clocks.

#### **3. Prioritize Critical Properties**

- **Verify safety only**: Linearizability and HLC causal order.
- **Test only critical failures**: Leader crash and 1-network partition.

#### **4. Optimize TLC Configuration**

- **Symmetry reduction**: Treat followers as interchangeable.
- **Limit transactions**: 3 concurrent ops instead of 500.
- **Constrain latency**: `ASSUME latency ≤ 16`.

#### **5. Incremental Verification**

1. **Phase 1**: Verify Raft alone with latency bounds.
2. **Phase 2**: Add parallel commits and check conflicts.
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate HLC causal ordering.

### **Deliverables**

1. **Minimal Integrated Model**:

   ```tla
   EXTENDS Raft, Integers
   VARIABLES committed, hlc, latency

   ParallelCommit ==
     ∧ LeaderAppendLog
     ∧ ∀ n ∈ Followers : SendIntent(n)
     ∧ WaitForQuorum(2/3)
     ∧ UpdateHLC()
     ∧ latency' = latency + 3 \* ms

   ASSUME MaxLatency == latency ≤ 16
   ```

2. **TLC Configuration**:
   ```bash
   tlc -workers 8 -depth 100 -config clusters=3 Model.tla
   ```

### **Effort & Savings**

| **Task**           | **Original** | **Optimized** | **Savings** |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| Model Integration  | 3 days       | 1 day         | 66%         |
| HLC Implementation | 2 days       | 0.5 days      | 75%         |
| Failure Scenarios  | 3 days       | 1 day         | 66%         |
| **Total**          | **19 days**  | **6.5 days**  | **66%**     |

---

### **Key Tradeoffs**

- **Less Realism**: No QUIC retransmission logic or large-scale workloads.
- **Partial Liveness**: Focus on safety; deadlines are approximate.
- **Scalability**: 3-node model extrapolates to larger clusters theoretically.

Execute this plan to achieve **70% of verification rigor for 30% of the cost**.
