# designing a leader-based event synchronization system for syncing Godot Engine node trees across multiple servers

\ <think>
Okay, the user is working on designing a leader-based event synchronization system for syncing Godot Engine node trees across multiple servers. They mentioned they need to ensure linearizability and reduce latency. Previously, they discussed using concepts from Raft and CockroachDB's parallel commits. Now, they want to know all the TLA+ systems they need, given that they have a reference Raft design and CockroachDB's parallel commit model but haven't written any TLA code yet.

First, I need to recall what TLA+ specs are relevant here. The user needs to model their system to ensure it meets the desired properties like linearizability, fault tolerance, etc. Since they mentioned Raft and CockroachDB's parallel commits, those are starting points. But they need a comprehensive list of TLA+ modules or systems to cover all aspects of their design.

Let me break down the components of their system:

1. **Leader Election**: Part of Raft, so they might need the TLA+ spec for Raft's leader election.
2. **Log Replication**: Another Raft component. Ensuring logs are replicated correctly across nodes.
3. **Parallel Commits**: From CockroachDB, which allows transactions to commit without a two-phase commit. They need to model this to handle cross-shard transactions.
4. **Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)**: For timestamp ordering events across servers. CockroachDB uses HLCs, so a TLA+ model for HLC would be necessary.
5. **Transaction Handling**: Including write intents, conflict resolution, and commit protocols.
6. **Fault Tolerance**: Handling leader crashes, network partitions, etc.
7. **State Machine**: Representing the Godot node tree and how state changes are applied.

Now, translating these into TLA+ modules:

- **Raft Leader Election**: They can refer to the existing Raft TLA+ spec but might need to adapt it for their hierarchical sharding.
- **Raft Log Replication**: Again, part of the standard Raft TLA+ model but tailored for node tree operations.
- **Parallel Commit Protocol**: Model the process of writing intents, getting acknowledgments, and committing without 2PC.
- **HLC Implementation**: A TLA+ module to handle the hybrid clocks, ensuring correct timestamp ordering.
- **Linearizability Checker**: A TLA+ module to verify that all operations appear to occur atomically in some order.
- **Fault Injection**: Modules to simulate leader failures, network delays, partitions.
- **Shard Management**: For hierarchical sharding of Godot nodes, handling shard assignments and cross-shard transactions.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Using HLC timestamps to resolve conflicts, modeled in TLA+.

Each of these components needs a corresponding TLA+ specification to verify the system's correctness. The user might also need to integrate these modules to work together, ensuring that the combination of Raft, parallel commits, and HLCs works correctly in their specific setup.

I should list these in a table, indicating the component, its purpose, the basis (like Raft or CockroachDB), and what needs to be verified. This will help the user systematically approach writing the TLA+ specs, starting from existing ones and adapting them, then creating new ones where necessary.

Potential challenges include integrating different protocols (Raft with parallel commits) and ensuring that the combination maintains linearizability. The user will need to verify that the parallel commit mechanism doesn't violate Raft's log consistency, for example. Also, modeling the HLC correctly to prevent causality issues.

In summary, the table should cover all critical aspects of their system, referencing existing TLA+ models where possible and highlighting areas where new specs are needed. This structured approach will guide them in developing the necessary TLA+ code to validate their design thoroughly.

Here’s a table of required TLA+ specifications for your system, building on Raft and CockroachDB concepts:

| **TLA+ Component**         | **Purpose**                                                          | **Based On**                     | **What to Verify**                                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **RaftLeaderElection**     | Leader election for shard groups                                     | Raft paper                       | Leader uniqueness, term monotonicity, failure recovery.                  |
| **RaftLogReplication**     | Replicating node tree operations (e.g., `add_child`, `set_property`) | Raft TLA+ model                  | Log matching, consistency across followers.                              |
| **ParallelCommitProtocol** | Cross-shard transactions without 2PC                                 | CockroachDB’s TLA+ model         | Atomicity: All intents commit or abort. No partial updates.              |
| **HybridLogicalClock**     | Global timestamping for event ordering                               | CockroachDB’s HLC implementation | Causal ordering: If event A → B, then `HLC(A) < HLC(B)`.                 |
| **LinearizabilityChecker** | Validate client-observed node tree states                            | Jepsen’s Knossos model           | All operations appear instantaneously in some global order.              |
| **NodeTreeStateMachine**   | Godot scene tree semantics (parent/child, transforms)                | Custom                           | Tree invariants preserved (e.g., no cycles, valid transforms).           |
| **FaultInjector**          | Simulate leader crashes, network partitions                          | TLA+ `RandomPaxos` example       | System recovers within bounded time; no data loss.                       |
| **ShardMembership**        | Dynamic shard assignment (e.g., moving subtrees between leaders)     | Raft + CRDB’s `system.ranges`    | Quiescent consistency: Membership changes don’t violate linearizability. |
| **IntentResolution**       | Cleanup orphaned write intents after crashes                         | CockroachDB’s intent handling    | All intents resolved eventually (no dangling locks).                     |
| **ConflictDetection**      | Handle concurrent updates to same node/property                      | CRDB’s `txnwait.Queue`           | Conflicting transactions abort; non-conflicting commit.                  |

### **Example: Parallel Commit TLA+ Snippet**

```tla
EXTENDS Integers, Sequences, TLC

CONSTANTS Shards, NodesPerShard

(* Parallel commit state *)
VARIABLES
    txns,           \* Set of active transactions
    intents,        \* { txn: {shard: intent_status} }
    committed        \* Committed transactions

TypeInvariant ==
    /\ txns \subseteq (DOMAIN intents)
    /\ committed \subseteq txns

CommitTxn(txn) ==
    /\ txn \in txns
    /\ \A shard \in Shards:
        intents[txn][shard] = "ACK"
    /\ committed' = committed \cup {txn}
    /\ UNCHANGED <<intents, txns>>

AbortTxn(txn) ==
    /\ txn \in txns
    /\ \E shard \in Shards:
        intents[txn][shard] \neq "ACK"
    /\ txns' = txns \ {txn}
    /\ UNCHANGED <<committed, intents>>
```

### **Verification Strategy**

1. **Model Check**

   - Use TLC to verify invariants (`TypeInvariant`, `Linearizability`).
   - Check liveness: All transactions eventually commit/abort (`<>committed \/ <>aborted`).

2. **Trace Exploration**

   - Seed with failure scenarios:
     ```tla
     CONSTANTS FailShard1, FailShard2
     ```
   - Verify recovery from partial writes.

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Compose modules (e.g., `RaftLeaderElection` + `ParallelCommitProtocol`).
   - Check for emergent behaviors (e.g., leader election interfering with commit).

---

### **Outcome**

This TLA+ suite will formally prove your system:

1. Maintains **linearizable node trees** under concurrency.
2. Survives **leader failures** and **network partitions**.
3. Correctly orders **cross-shard operations** via HLC.
4. Resolves **conflicting updates** atomically.

Start with the Raft and CockroachDB TLA+ models, then extend with Godot-specific logic.
