# wants a summary to recreate the discussion

\<think>

Okay, the user has been discussing the implementation of a leader-based event synchronization system for syncing Godot Engine node trees across multiple servers. They wanted a production-ready design with linearizability, low latency, and fault tolerance. I provided a detailed architecture using Raft for sharding, Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs) for ordering, and parallel commits inspired by CockroachDB. The user also asked about testing strategies using TLA+ and an Elixir compiler, so I outlined how to model check components and generate tests.

Now, the user needs to go offline and wants a summary to recreate the discussion. I need to encapsulate all the key points: the system design, TLA+ specifications, testing approach, and implementation steps. I should structure it clearly so they can refer back without missing any critical parts. Let me make sure to include the architecture, TLA+ modules, testing steps, and code examples. Also, highlight the main takeaways and resources they might need. Alright, putting it all together concisely.

Here's a concise summary of our discussion for easy reference:

---

### **1. System Design**

**Goal**: Sync Godot node trees across servers with **linearizability**, **low latency**, and **fault tolerance**.  
**Architecture**:

- **Hierarchical Sharding**: Divide node trees into subtrees managed by Raft groups.
- **Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLCs)**: Global timestamping for event ordering.
- **Parallel Commits**: CockroachDB-style cross-shard transactions without 2PC.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Raft leader election, intent cleanup, and quorum writes.

**Key Components**:

- **Raft Leaders**: Manage shard-specific event logs.
- **HLC Timestamps**: Ensure causal ordering.
- **Intent Resolution**: Handle partial failures.

### **2. TLA+ Specifications**

| **Module**               | **Purpose**                       | **Dependencies**                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `RaftLeaderElection`     | Leader election for shard groups. | Raft paper TLA+ model.             |
| `ParallelCommitProtocol` | Atomic cross-shard commits.       | CockroachDBâ€™s TLA+ implementation. |
| `HybridLogicalClock`     | Global event ordering.            | HLC paper.                         |
| `LinearizabilityChecker` | Validate client-observed state.   | Jepsenâ€™s Knossos model.            |

**Example TLA+ Code**:

```tla
CommitTxn(txn) ==
    /\ \A shard \in Shards: intents[txn][shard] = "ACK"
    /\ committed' = committed \cup {txn}
```

---

### **3. Testing Strategy**

1. **TLC Model Checking**:
   - Verify invariants (e.g., `NoConflictingCommits`).
   - Check liveness (e.g., `<>committed`).
2. **Elixir Test Generation**:
   - Convert TLA+ traces to property-based tests.
   - Example:
     ```elixir
     test "linearizable updates" do
       assert Leader.get_node("Player1").position == {10, 20}
     end
     ```
3. **Fault Injection**:
   - Simulate leader crashes, network partitions.

---

### **4. Implementation Steps**

1. **Shard Assignment**:
   ```gdscript
   func get_shard(node_path: String) -> String:
       return consistent_hash(node_path, shard_list)
   ```
2. **Event Logging**:
   - Leaders log events with HLC timestamps.
3. **Sync Protocol**:
   - Clients send updates to shard leaders.
   - Leaders replicate via Raft, resolve conflicts via HLC.

---

### **5. Key Resources**

- **Raft TLA+**: [github.com/ongardie/raft.tla](https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla)
- **CockroachDB TLA+**: [github.com/cockroachdb](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/tree/master/pkg/concurrency/tla)
- **HLC Paper**: [CSE Buffalo](https://cse.buffalo.edu/tech-reports/2014-04.pdf)

---

### **6. Takeaways**

- Use **Raft for shard consistency** and **HLC for global ordering**.
- **Parallel commits** reduce latency vs. 2PC.
- Test with **TLC for safety** and **Elixir for runtime checks**.
